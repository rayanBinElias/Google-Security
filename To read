	Question 6 tested your knowledge of the steps to create custom IAM roles.

	1.3 Managing authentication
	
	Considerations include: 
		● Creating a password and session management policy for user accounts 
		● Setting up Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OAuth 
		● Configuring and enforcing two-step verification

	To read:
		● https://support.google.com/a/answer/9368756?hl=en

	Summary:
		As an administrator, you can control how long different users can access the Google
		Cloud console and Cloud SDK without having to reauthenticate. For example, you
		might want users with elevated privileges, like project owners, billing administrators,
		or others with administrator roles, to reauthenticate more frequently than regular
		users. If you set a session length, they’re prompted to sign in again to start a new 
		session.
		
		The session length setting applies to:
			● The Google Cloud console
			● The gcloud command-line tool (Cloud SDK)
			● Any applications (including third-party applications, or your own applications)
			that require user authorization for Google Cloud scopes. To review the apps
			requiring Google Cloud scopes in the Apps access control UI, see Control
			which third-party & internal apps access Google Workspace data.

	Considerations include: 
		● Managing privileged roles and separation of duties with Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions 
		● Managing IAM and access control list (ACL) permissions 
		● Granting permissions to different types of identities, including using IAM conditions and IAM deny policies 
		● Designing identity roles at the organization, folder, project, and resource level ● Configuring Access Context Manager 
		● Applying Policy Intelligence for better permission management 
		● Managing permissions through groups

	Question 7 tested your understanding of using roles at different levels of an organizational hierarchy.

	Question 8 asked you to select basic, predefined, or custom IAM roles for a specific scenario.

	Where to look:
		● https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles
		● https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#app-engine-roles


	Summary:
		IAM roles are of 3 types: basic, predefined, and custom. Basic roles of ‘Owner,’
		‘Editor,’ and ‘Viewer’ provide a large set of broad permissions that existed before IAM.
		Most often, basic roles are not recommended because of the large number of
		permissions they contain. Predefined roles limit the permissions and access that a
		role has and are defined separately for each Google Cloud resource. Create custom
		roles when the predefined roles provide more permission than required.

	1.5 Defining resource hierarchy
	
	Considerations include: 
		● Creating and managing organizations at scale 
		● Managing organization policies for organization folders, projects, and resources 
		● Using resource hierarchy for access control and permissions inheritance


	Question 9 asked you to create a resource hierarchy that aligns with a given organizational structure and access control requirements. Question 10 tested your knowledge of designing a hierarchy and policies to control access to Google Cloud resources.

	Where to look:
		https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/understanding-hierarchy

	Summary:
		Organization hierarchy helps build an inheritance of policies and permissions.
		Although Projects can be placed directly in an Organization, creating layers of folders
		in between helps with managing different permissions for different access. You can
		also use folders to derive an inheritance of policies and permissions.

	Question 10 tested your knowledge of designing a hierarchy and policies to control access to Google Cloud resources.

  Summary:
    Google Cloud Armor provides capabilities to help protect your Google Cloud
    applications against a variety of Layer 3 and Layer 7 attacks. Google Cloud Armor
    security policies filter incoming traffic that is destined to global external HTTP(S) load
    balancers or global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic)s. Rate-based rules help
    you protect your applications from a large volume of requests that flood your
    instances and block access for legitimate users.

	3.1 Protecting sensitive data and preventing data loss
	Considerations include:
		● Inspecting and redacting personally identifiable information (PII)
		● Ensuring continuous discovery of sensitive data (structured and unstructured)
		● Configuring pseudonymization
		● Configuring format-preserving encryption
		● Restricting access to BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL datastores
		● Securing secrets with Secrets Manager
		● Protecting and managing compute instance metadata


	Question 1 tested your knowledge of configuring DLP to automatically inspect and redact personally identifiable information (PII).

		● https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/concepts-image-redaction
		● https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/redacting-sensitive-data-images
		● https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference


	Summary:
		The Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API can redact images, documents, and text. It offers built-in and custom infoTypes that can help identify sensitive information. Using one of the supported programming languages, you can programmatically make redact image requests to the DLP API.

	Question 4 explored your understanding of Secrets Manager.
	
	Where to look: 
		https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/access-control

	Summary:
		- Secret Manager helps save confidential details such as passwords and URLs. You can provide access to secrets using IAM. Secret Manager lets organizations share configured secrets instead of confidential information with developers. Cloud KMS is used for storing encryption keys that are either managed by Google or by the customer.

		- Cloud KMS lets you share symmetric and asymmetric keys. Cloud KMS can be used to encrypt/decrypt data, but that will expose critical information to developers in plain text.

		ks
		● https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/custom-boot-disks
		● https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/using-other-products#cmek_integrations

	Summary:
		All Google Cloud resources default to have data encrypted at rest. You can use Google-managed encryption keys to further encrypt GKE clusters, Compute Engine instance boot disks, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery. Alternatively, you could use customer-managed encryption keys to rotate keys.

	Question 7 tested your understanding of confidential VMs and their benefits.

	Where to look: 
		https://cloud.google.com/compute/confidential-vm/docs/about-cvm

	Summary:
		- Confidential VMs use AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization, which keeps data encrypted in RAM. They can be managed using Customer-Supplied or Customer-Managed Encryption Keys. These instances contain dedicated AES engines that encrypt data as it flows out of sockets and decrypt data when it is read.
		
		- When restarting, Confidential VMs generate a unique log called Launch Attestation. Cloud Logging can be used to filter the logs and collect sevLaunchAttestationReportEvent.

	3.3 Planning for security and privacy in AI 
	Considerations include:
		● Implementing security controls for AI/ML systems (e.g., protecting against unintentional exploitation of data or models)
		● Determining security requirements for IaaS-hosted and PaaS-hosted training models


	Question 9 asked you what should you prioritize when defining security requirements. 

	Where to look:
		● https://cloud.google.com/learn/paas-vs-iaas-vs-saas


	Summary:
		- Understand the specific regulations and compliance requirements that dictate where your data can be stored and processed. Configure your cloud environment to enforce these restrictions to maintain control over data location.
		
		- Implement a fine-grained approach to authorization. Define precise permissions that determine who can access specific models and what actions they can perform. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or model misuse.

	Question 10 checked your knowledge on how to plan for AI/ML specific security controls when developing a system.


	Summary:
		AI systems often have complex dependencies on other systems and data sources. This interconnectedness introduces new attack surfaces that may not be present in traditional software. Thoroughly map out these dependencies and potential vulnerabilities to proactively mitigate risks.
